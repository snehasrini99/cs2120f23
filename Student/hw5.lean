We've seen that we can generalize the notion of
mapping objects of one container-like type to
objects of a correspond value of the same type
by replacing each *element* in one container
corresponding objects computed by applying an
element-wise conversion function to each object
in the input container. Here we give two examples
that we saw in class: functions for mapping over
Lists, and functions for mapping over Options.
-/

def list_map {α β : Type} : (α → β) → List α → List β
| _, [] => []
| f, h::t => f h :: list_map f t

def option_map {α β : Type} : (α → β) → Option α → Option β
| _, Option.none => Option.none
| f, (Option.some a) => some (f a)

/-!
We now present two more "container-like" types that
we saw in class. The Box type is a container type for
exactly one object some type, α, and Tree is such a
type for representing binary trees of such objects.
-/
inductive Box (α : Type)
| contents (a : α)

inductive Tree (α : Type): Type
| empty
| node (a : α) (l r : Tree α) : Tree α

/-! Problem #1
Define box_map and tree_map functions and
use #eval to give examples of applying these
functions to a few arguments.
-/

def box_map {α β : Type}: (α → β) → Box α → Box β
| f, Box.contents a => Box.contents (f a)

def tree_map {α β : Type}: (α → β) → Tree α → Tree β
| _, Tree.empty => Tree.empty
| f, Tree.node a l r =>  Tree.node (f a) (tree_map f l) (tree_map f r)

def atree:=
  Tree.node
  1
  (Tree.node
  2
  Tree.empty
  Tree.empty)
  (Tree.node
  3
  Tree.empty
  Tree.empty)

#reduce atree

#reduce tree_map Nat.succ atree

#reduce box_map Nat.succ (Box.contents 3)

The functor type, below, generalizes the idea
that we can map over *any* polymorphic container
type. The functor type takes a polymorphic type
(builder), such as List or Option, and augments
it with a map function for objects of that type.
Here we don't try to specify rules for functors.
We'll see them shortly. For now the definition
follows has everything we need.
-/
/-! here c is the container here it takes a tyoe builders (tyoe to type)
ex: list, tree, box, option-/
structure functor (c : Type → Type) where
map {α β : Type} (f : α → β) (ic : c α) : c β

/-!
Here are functor *instances* for the polymorphic
container-like List and Option types.
-/

def list_functor : functor List  := functor.mk list_map
def option_functor : functor Option  := functor.mk option_map

/-! Problem #2

Complete the definition of a polymorphic do_map
function. Note that this function, map, is not
the same as the functor field value, functor.map.
Hint: See the "convert" function from class.
-/
def do_map {α β : Type} {c : Type → Type} (m : functor c) :
  (f : α → β) → c α → c β
| f, c => m.map f c

-- def do_map {α β : Type} {c : Type → Type} (m : functor c) :
--   (f : α → β) → c α → c β
-- | f, c => m.map f c

-- These test cases should succeed when do_map is right
#eval do_map list_functor Nat.succ [1,2,3]  -- [2, 3, 4]
#eval do_map option_functor (λ s => s ++ "!") (some "Hi")




/-! Problem #3

Briefly explain why you can't apply map to a value of type
(Tree Nat) at this point.

Here:
-/
/-! This is because we havent created a functor instance for Type Tree-/


/-! Problem #4

Define functor instances for Box and Tree.
-/
def tree_functor : functor Tree := functor.mk tree_map
def box_functor : functor Box := functor.mk box_map



/-! Problem #5

Give working examples, using #eval, of applying do_map
to a Box Nat and Tree String values.
-/

def btree:=
  Tree.node
  "Hey"
  (Tree.node
  "Hola"
  Tree.empty
  Tree.empty)
  (Tree.node
  "Hi"
  Tree.empty
  Tree.empty)

#reduce btree

#reduce do_map tree_functor Nat.succ atree
#reduce do_map tree_functor (λ s => s ++ "!") btree

#reduce do_map box_functor Nat.succ (Box.contents 1)


/-!
Here's an infix notation for do_map and a few examples
of its use.
-/

infix:50 "<$>"  => do_map
#eval Nat.succ <$> [1,2,3]
#eval (λ s => s ++ "!") <$> ["Hi", "Yo"]

/-! Problem #6

Rewrite your/our examples of mapping over List,
Option, Box, and Tree values using <$> notation.
-/

#eval (λ s => s*4)  <$> [1,2,3]
#eval (λ s => s ++ "!")  <$>  (some "Hi")
#reduce( tree_functor <$> Nat.succ) atree
#reduce (box_functor <$>  Nat.succ) (Box.contents 2)
